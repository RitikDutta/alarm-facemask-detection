# Mask detection
Our face mask detection project uses computer vision technology to accurately detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in public spaces. The project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, a small and affordable computer that is well-suited for running machine learning algorithms.

Using advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques, our face mask detection system is able to quickly and accurately identify individuals wearing face masks in real-time. The system can be easily integrated into existing surveillance systems and can be used to alert authorities or security personnel if individuals are not wearing masks in public spaces.

In addition to its accuracy and real-time capabilities, our face mask detection system is also highly efficient and can run on low-power devices such as the Raspberry Pi. This makes it a cost-effective solution for businesses and organizations looking to implement face mask detection technology.

Overall, our face mask detection project is a valuable tool for helping to enforce face mask mandates and keep individuals safe in public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic.
